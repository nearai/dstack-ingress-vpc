# Custom Domain Setup for dstack Applications

This repository provides a solution for setting up custom domains with automatic SSL certificate management for dstack applications using various DNS providers and Let's Encrypt.

## Overview

This project enables you to run dstack applications with your own custom domain, complete with:

- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal via Let's Encrypt
- Multi-provider DNS support (Cloudflare, Linode DNS, more to come)
- Automatic DNS configuration for CNAME, TXT, and CAA records
- Nginx reverse proxy to route traffic to your application
- Certificate evidence generation for verification
- Strong SSL/TLS configuration with modern cipher suites (AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305)

## How It Works

The dstack-ingress system provides a seamless way to set up custom domains for dstack applications with automatic SSL certificate management. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Setup**:

   - When first deployed, the container automatically obtains SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt using DNS validation
   - It configures your DNS provider by creating necessary CNAME, TXT, and optional CAA records
   - Nginx is configured to use the obtained certificates and proxy requests to your application

2. **DNS Configuration**:

   - A CNAME record is created to point your custom domain to the dstack gateway domain
   - A TXT record is added with application identification information to help dstack-gateway to route traffic to your application
   - If enabled, CAA records are set to restrict which Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for your domain
   - The system automatically detects your DNS provider based on environment variables

3. **Certificate Management**:

   - SSL certificates are automatically obtained during initial setup
   - A simple background daemon checks for certificate renewal every 12 hours
   - When certificates are renewed, Nginx is automatically reloaded to use the new certificates
   - Uses a simple sleep loop instead of cron for reliability and easier debugging in containers

4. **Evidence Generation**:
   - The system generates evidence files for verification purposes
   - These include the ACME account information and certificate data
   - Evidence files are accessible through a dedicated endpoint

## Features

### Multi-Domain Support (New!)

The dstack-ingress now supports multiple domains in a single container:

- **Single Domain Mode** (backward compatible): Use `DOMAIN` and `TARGET_ENDPOINT` environment variables
- **Multi-Domain Mode**: Use `DOMAINS` environment variable with custom nginx configurations in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`
- Each domain gets its own SSL certificate
- Flexible nginx configuration per domain

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Host your domain on one of the supported DNS providers
- Have appropriate API credentials for your DNS provider (see [DNS Provider Configuration](DNS_PROVIDERS.md) for details)

### Deployment

You can either build the ingress container and push it to docker hub, or use the prebuilt image at `dstacktee/dstack-ingress:20250924`.

#### Option 1: Use the Pre-built Image

The fastest way to get started is to use our pre-built image. Simply use the following docker-compose configuration:

```yaml
services:
  dstack-ingress:
    image: dstacktee/dstack-ingress:20250929@sha256:2b47b3e538df0b3e7724255b89369194c8c83a7cfba64d2faf0115ad0a586458
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    environment:
      # DNS Provider
      - DNS_PROVIDER=cloudflare

      # Cloudflare example
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}

      # Common configuration
      - DOMAIN=${DOMAIN}
      - GATEWAY_DOMAIN=${GATEWAY_DOMAIN}
      - CERTBOT_EMAIL=${CERTBOT_EMAIL}
      - SET_CAA=true
      - TARGET_ENDPOINT=http://app:80
    volumes:
      - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
      - cert-data:/etc/letsencrypt
    restart: unless-stopped
  app:
    image: nginx # Replace with your application image
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  cert-data: # Persistent volume for certificates
```

### Multi-Domain Configuration

```yaml
services:
  ingress:
    image: dstacktee/dstack-ingress:20250929@sha256:2b47b3e538df0b3e7724255b89369194c8c83a7cfba64d2faf0115ad0a586458
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    environment:
      DNS_PROVIDER: cloudflare
      CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
      CERTBOT_EMAIL: ${CERTBOT_EMAIL}
      GATEWAY_DOMAIN: _.dstack-prod5.phala.network
      SET_CAA: true
      DOMAINS: |
        ${APP_DOMAIN}
        ${API_DOMAIN}

    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
      - letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt

    configs:
      - source: app_conf
        target: /etc/nginx/conf.d/app.conf
        mode: 0444
      - source: api_conf
        target: /etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf
        mode: 0444

    restart: unless-stopped

  app-main:
    image: nginx
    restart: unless-stopped

  app-api:
    image: nginx
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  letsencrypt:

configs:
  app_conf:
    content: |
      server {
          listen 443 ssl;
          server_name ${APP_DOMAIN};
          ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/${APP_DOMAIN}/fullchain.pem;
          ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/${APP_DOMAIN}/privkey.pem;
          location / {
              proxy_pass http://app-main:80;
          }
      }
  api_conf:
    content: |
      server {
          listen 443 ssl;
          server_name ${API_DOMAIN};
          ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/${API_DOMAIN}/fullchain.pem;
          ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/${API_DOMAIN}/privkey.pem;
          location / {
              proxy_pass http://app-api:80;
          }
      }
```

**Core Environment Variables:**

- `DNS_PROVIDER`: DNS provider to use (cloudflare, linode)
- `DOMAIN`: Your custom domain (for single domain mode)
- `DOMAINS`: Multiple domains, one per line (supports environment variable substitution like `${APP_DOMAIN}`)
- `GATEWAY_DOMAIN`: The dstack gateway domain (e.g. `_.dstack-prod5.phala.network` for Phala Cloud)
- `CERTBOT_EMAIL`: Your email address used in Let's Encrypt certificate requests
- `TARGET_ENDPOINT`: The plain HTTP endpoint of your dstack application (for single domain mode)
- `SET_CAA`: Set to `true` to enable CAA record setup
- `CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE`: Optional value for nginx `client_max_body_size` (e.g. `50m`) in single-domain mode

**Backward Compatibility:**

- If both `DOMAIN` and `TARGET_ENDPOINT` are set, the system operates in single-domain mode with auto-generated nginx config
- If `DOMAINS` is set, the system operates in multi-domain mode and expects custom nginx configs in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`
- You can use both modes simultaneously

For provider-specific configuration details, see [DNS Provider Configuration](DNS_PROVIDERS.md).

#### Option 2: Build Your Own Image

If you prefer to build the image yourself:

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the Docker image using the provided build script:

```bash
./build-image.sh yourusername/dstack-ingress:tag
```

**Important**: You must use the `build-image.sh` script to build the image. This script ensures reproducible builds with:

- Specific buildkit version (v0.20.2)
- Deterministic timestamps (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0`)
- Package pinning for consistency
- Git revision tracking

Direct `docker build` commands will not work properly due to the specialized build requirements.

3. Push to your registry (optional):

```bash
docker push yourusername/dstack-ingress:tag
```

4. Update the docker-compose.yaml file with your image name and deploy

#### gRPC Support

If your dstack application uses gRPC, you can set `TARGET_ENDPOINT` to `grpc://app:50051`.

example:

```yaml
services:
  dstack-ingress:
    image: dstacktee/dstack-ingress:20250929@sha256:2b47b3e538df0b3e7724255b89369194c8c83a7cfba64d2faf0115ad0a586458
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    environment:
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
      - DOMAIN=${DOMAIN}
      - GATEWAY_DOMAIN=${GATEWAY_DOMAIN}
      - CERTBOT_EMAIL=${CERTBOT_EMAIL}
      - SET_CAA=true
      - TARGET_ENDPOINT=grpc://app:50051
    volumes:
      - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
      - cert-data:/etc/letsencrypt
    restart: unless-stopped
  app:
    image: your-grpc-app
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  cert-data:
```

## Domain Attestation and Verification

The dstack-ingress system provides mechanisms to verify and attest that your custom domain endpoint is secure and properly configured. This comprehensive verification approach ensures the integrity and authenticity of your application.

### Evidence Collection

When certificates are issued or renewed, the system automatically generates a set of cryptographically linked evidence files:

1. **Access Evidence Files**:

   - Evidence files are accessible at `https://your-domain.com/evidences/`
   - Key files include `acme-account.json`, `cert.pem`, `sha256sum.txt`, and `quote.json`

2. **Verification Chain**:

   - `quote.json` contains a TDX quote with the SHA-256 digest of `sha256sum.txt` embedded in the report_data field
   - `sha256sum.txt` contains cryptographic checksums of both `acme-account.json` and `cert.pem`
   - When the TDX quote is verified, it cryptographically proves the integrity of the entire evidence chain

3. **Certificate Authentication**:
   - `acme-account.json` contains the ACME account credentials used to request certificates
   - When combined with the CAA DNS record, this provides evidence that certificates can only be requested from within this specific TEE application
   - `cert.pem` is the Let's Encrypt certificate currently serving your custom domain

### CAA Record Verification

If you've enabled CAA records (`SET_CAA=true`), you can verify that only authorized Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for your domain:

```bash
dig CAA your-domain.com
```

The output will display CAA records that restrict certificate issuance exclusively to Let's Encrypt with your specific account URI, providing an additional layer of security.

### TLS Certificate Transparency

All Let's Encrypt certificates are logged in public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, enabling independent verification:

**CT Log Verification**:

- Visit [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) and search for your domain
- Confirm that the certificates match those issued by the dstack-ingress system
- This public logging ensures that all certificates are visible and can be monitored for unauthorized issuance
